Features

Add Word: Insert a word into the hash table.

Remove Word: Delete a word from the hash table.

Search Word: Check if a word exists in the hash table.

Visualization: Visual representation of the hash table and linked lists on a canvas, with color-coded cells.

Technologies Used

Angular: Framework for building the user interface and managing application logic.

TypeScript: Programming language used for developing the application.

HTML5 Canvas: Used for drawing and visualizing the hash table.
